    <h1 class="heading"> About the project </h1>
    <p class="first_text"> 
       Nowadays economics looks like very complex discipline which only professionals can understand and this is true, but only in part. Foundations of economics are actually easy to understand, but they are rarely well explained. That's why I decided to create this project. A lot of people I know don't waht to learn economics because it's hard to understand even simple concepts, so I tried to explain everything in an understandable way. Information which is used is from open source organizations. I asked some of professors from universities (I won't mention them because of their privacy) to read the webpage and they said it's correct. Unfortunately, everyone makes mistakes, so if you will find an inaccuracy or a mistake, feel free to reach out. I will live my contact information below. Thanks everyone for engaging and enjoy learning!
