        In this lesson we will talk about banking. Banks play a crucial role in the financial system by facilitating the flow of money, providing various financial services, and ensuring economic stability. They are vital for individuals, businesses, and governments to manage their finances efficiently, access credit, and safeguard their savings.

        <h3>What Is a Bank?</h3>
        A <b>bank</b> is a financial institution that is licensed to accept checking and savings deposits and make loans. Banks also provide related services such as individual retirement accounts (IRAs), certificates of deposit (CDs), currency exchange, and safe deposit boxes.
            
        There are several types of banks including retail banks, commercial or corporate banks, and investment banks.

        <b>Basic bank services.</b>  Banks offer various ways to stash your cash and various ways to borrow money.
        <ul>
            <li>Cheking accounts</li>
            <li>Savings accounts</li>
            <li>Loan services</li>
        </ul>
        Savings accounts pay interest to the depositor. Depending on how long account holders hope to keep their money in the bank, they can open a regular savings account that pays a little interest or a certificate of deposit (CD) that pays a little more interest. The CDs can earn interest for as little as a few months or as long as five years or more. Banks make loans to consumers and businesses. The cash that is deposited by their customers is lent out to other customers at a higher rate of interest than the depositor is paid. Checking accounts are deposits used by consumers and businesses to pay their bills and make cash withdrawals. They pay little or no interest and typically come with monthly fees, usage fees, or both.

        <h3>History of banks</h3>
        People tend to believe that banks existed since the creation of first currencies. Below you will find key events in banking history and you will understand how banks changed overtime.
        <p>After people started using metal coins as their form of money they encountered a problem of keeping them safe. People started to keep their coins and jewels in temples. They seemed more secure because of the presence of priests and guards.</p>
        <p>Historical records from Greece, Rome, Egypt, and Babylon suggest that temples loaned money in addition to keeping it safe. The fact that temples often functioned as the financial centers of their cities is one reason why they were inevitably ransacked during wars.</p>
        <p>During the <b>Middle Ages</b> in Europe, banking underwent significant development, particularly in the flourishing trade cities of Italy. The concept of banking as we understand it today has its roots in the 11th and 12th centuries, when the term ‘bank’ was first introduced by Lombard and other Italian merchants to signify the business of money. The Bardi and Peruzzi families of Florence were prominent bankers by the 14th century, establishing branches across Europe and laying the groundwork for modern banking practices. The Medici Bank, established in 1397 by Giovanni Medici, became one of the most famous Italian banks, symbolizing the rise of financial empires during this era. These banks facilitated the growth of commerce and the financial industry, marking a pivotal shift from the earlier, more localized systems of trade and barter.</p>
        <p>The evolution of banking in Europe from the Middle Ages was marked by significant milestones. After the foundational period of medieval banking, the 16th centurysaw the full development of an international money market with supporting institutions. South German banking houses, particularly from Augsburg and Nürnberg, played a crucial role as financial intermediaries between southern and northern Europe.</p>
        <p>The 17th century witnessed the emergence of modern banking, with important innovations taking place in Amsterdam during the Dutch Republic. This period also saw the rise of the Bank of England in 1694, which was established to raise money for King William III’s war against France.</p>
        <p>Moving into the 18th and 19th centuries, the expansion of the European economy necessitated the growth of a more sophisticated banking system. The Industrial Revolution brought about a need for large-scale investments and financial services, leading to the establishment of many new banks and financial institutions across Europe.</p>
        <p>By the 20th century, advancements in telecommunications and computing revolutionized banking operations, allowing banks to increase dramatically in size and geographic spread. However, the century also experienced significant challenges, including the Great Depression</p>
        <h3>2008 Financial crisis</h3>
        <p>I decided to explore this event separetely because of its significance to modern day banking. </p>
        <p>The 2008 financial crisis, also known as the global financial crisis, was a severe worldwide economic downturn that originated from the collapse of the U.S. housing market. It led to a significant contraction of liquidity in global financial markets and threatened the international financial system. The crisis caused the failure or near-failure of several major investment and commercial banks, mortgage lenders, insurance companies, and savings and loan associations, precipitating the Great Recession, the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Key factors contributing to the crisis included the availability of cheap credit, the creation of a housing bubble, and high-risk lending practices. The aftermath saw governments around the world implementing massive bailouts and fiscal policies to prevent a total financial collapse.</p>

        <h2>Why banks matter?</h2>
        <p>Banks often find themselves at the center of controversy, with some voices in society labeling them as ‘evil’ due to their role in financial crises or perceived greed. However, this view oversimplifies the complex role banks play in our economy and society. Let’s explore why banks are not the villains they are sometimes made out to be.</p>
        <p>At their core, banks are intermediaries that facilitate a wide range of economic activities. They match up savers and borrowers, ensuring that economies function smoothly. Without banks, it would be nearly impossible for the average person to find a borrower or lender that meets their specific needs. Banks pool funds from depositors and lend them to those in need, whether it’s for buying a house, starting a business, or funding education.</p>
        <p>Banks also play a crucial role in the stability and growth of the global economy. They contribute to liquidity in the market, making it easier for businesses to invest and expand, which in turn fuels economic growth. Moreover, banks are central to the domestic and international payments system, processing transactions ranging from personal checks to large-value electronic payments between banks.</p>
        <p>The notion that banks are inherently evil often stems from high-profile scandals and the aftermath of financial crises. It’s true that there have been instances where banks have engaged in unethical behavior, leading to public distrust. However, it’s important to recognize that not all bankers or banking activities are unethical. The industry attracts a diverse range of individuals, and while some may behave badly, many are committed to ethical practices and the well-being of their clients.</p>
        <p>Far from being evil, banks provide opportunities for people to improve their lives. They offer services and products that help individuals and businesses get ahead. Credit provided by banks has been a great equalizer, enabling the middle class and even the poor to achieve their dreams. In developing economies, banks have been instrumental in providing microloans and savings options, significantly improving the lives of the ultra-poor.
        While it’s easy to point fingers at banks during times of economic hardship, it’s crucial to understand their fundamental role in our society. Banks are not monolithic entities; they are made up of individuals who, like in any industry, can range from the highly ethical to the less scrupulous. The key is to ensure that the banking system remains transparent, regulated, and focused on serving the needs of the community. By doing so, we can harness the positive power of banks to support economic growth, stability, and opportunity for all.
