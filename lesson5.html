        This lesson will be short, but very important. There are the two main branches of economics. Macroeconomics deals with the economic activity in aggregate such as national income, overall price levels, and inflation. Microeconomics focuses on individual and business decisions regarding the allocation of resources and the prices of goods and services.        <br>
        Let's begin!

        <h2>Microeconomics</h2>
        <p> <b>Microeconomics </b> focuses on the behavior of individual agents within an economy. These agents can be households, firms, or specific markets.</p>
        <p>Microeconomics examines how individual consumers make choices based on their preferences and constraints, analyzes the supply and demand dynamics in specific markets (e.g., the market for smartphones or coffee), investigates how firms decide on production levels, pricing, and resource allocation.</p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A firm determining the optimal quantity of a product to produce to maximize profits.</li>
            <li>The interaction of supply and demand determining the price of apples in the market.</li>
            <li>Your brother deciding between going to the movies or having dinner at a restaurant.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Microeconomics provides insights into everyday decision-making and market interactions.</p>

        <h2>Macroeconomics</h2>
        <p>  <b>Macroeconomics </b>looks at the entire economy as a whole. It deals with aggregate variables and national-level phenomena.</p>
        <p> Macroeconomics studies overall economic performance, including GDP, inflation, and unemployment.
            analyzes government policies (monetary and fiscal) and their impact on the economy,
            explores international trade, exchange rates, and global economic interdependencies.</p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Central banks adjusting interest rates to influence economic growth.</li>
            <li>Government advisors assessing the impact of a fiscal stimulus package on unemployment.</li>
            <li>The overall price level affected by aggregate supply and demand.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Macroeconomics helps us understand the big picture and formulate policies to stabilize the economy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block-text">
        <p>Microeconomics and macroeconomics are intertwined. For instance, government monetary policy (e.g., interest rates) falls under macroeconomics but influences microeconomic factors like commercial bank loans.</p>
