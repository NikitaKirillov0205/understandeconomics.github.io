        In this lesson we will talk about securities. Securities are versatile instruments that represent financial value and can be traded in the market. They come in various forms, such as stocks, bonds, options, and futures, each with its unique characteristics and purposes.
        <br>
        <br>
        Let's begin!

        <h3>What are securities?</h3>
        The term <b>security</b> refers to a multitude of different investments, such as stocks, bonds, investment contracts, notes, and derivatives. For example, a security can represent ownership in a corporation in the form of stock, a creditor relationship with a governmental body or corporation in the form of a bond, or rights to ownership in the form of an option.
        There are several types of securities including stocks, bonds, futures etc.

        <b>Types of securities</b> (we will dive into each one below)
        <ul>
            <li>Equity Securities</li>
            <li>Debt Securities</li>
            <li>Hybrid Securities</li>
            <li>Derivative Securities</li>
            <li>Asset-Backed Securities</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="block-text">
        <h3>Equity securities</h3>
        <p>An equity security represents ownership interest held by shareholders in an entity (a company, partnership, or trust), realized in the form of shares of capital stock, which includes shares of both common and preferred stock. Equity securities include common stocks, preferred stocks, and stock options. Common stocks offer voting rights and dividends. Preferred stocks provide fixed dividends and priority in asset claims.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block-text">
        <h3>Debt securities</h3>
        <p>A debt security represents borrowed money that must be repaid, with terms that stipulate the size of the loan, interest rate, and maturity or renewal date.

            Debt securities, which include government and corporate bonds, certificates of deposit (CDs), and collateralized securities (such as CDOs​ and CMOs​), generally entitle their holder to the regular payment of interest and repayment of principal (regardless of the issuer's performance), along with any other stipulated contractual rights (which do not include voting rights).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block-text">
        <h3>Hybrid securities</h3>
        <p>Hybrid securities, as the name suggests, combine some of the characteristics of both debt and equity securities.

            Examples of hybrid securities include equity warrants (options issued by the company itself that give shareholders the right to purchase stock within a certain timeframe and at a specific price), convertible bonds (bonds that can be converted into shares of common stock in the issuing company), and preference shares (company stocks whose payments of interest, dividends, or other returns of capital can be prioritized over those of other stockholders).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block-text">
        <h3>Derivative securities</h3>
        <p>A derivative is a type of financial contract whose price is determined by the value of some underlying asset, such as a stock, bond, or commodity. Among the most commonly traded derivatives are call options, which gain value if the underlying asset appreciates, and put options, which gain value when the underlying asset loses value.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block-text">
        <h3> Asset-Backed Securities</h3>
        <p>An asset-backed security represents a part of a large basket of similar assets, such as loans, leases, credit card debts, mortgages, or anything else that generates income. Over time, the cash flow from these assets is pooled and distributed among the different investors.</p>

        <h1>How to trade securities?</h1>
        <p>To trade securities, you’ll begin by opening a brokerage account where you can hold and manage your investments. Reflect on your trading style, whether it’s short-term or long-term, and consider how much risk you’re comfortable taking and the time you can dedicate to trading. It’s important to choose a brokerage that suits your needs and provides the necessary tools for trading. <br> <br> Before you start trading, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research. This can involve fundamental analysis, which looks at financial statements and market conditions, or technical analysis, which focuses on patterns in trading activity and price movements. <br> Understanding the different types of orders, such as market orders and limit orders, will also help you execute trades according to your strategy. <br> <br>  If you’re new to trading, consider practicing with a paper trading account, which allows you to simulate trading without risking real money. This is a great way to test out your strategies and get a feel for the market. <br> <br> When you’re ready to trade with real money, set a budget for how much you’re willing to invest and potentially lose on each trade.Developing a risk management plan is another key step, which should include strategies like proper position sizing, setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, and diversifying your portfolio to spread risk. As you trade, keep track of your performance and compare it to benchmarks to gauge your success. <br> <br> Lastly, remember that the markets are constantly changing, so it’s important to stay informed and continue learning. By adapting your strategies and staying educated, you’ll be better equipped to navigate the complexities of trading securities. And always remember, trading involves risks, so approach it with caution and a well-thought-out plan.</p>

        <h3>Stocks & bonds</h3>
        <p>You already know about types of securities, but usually it's confusing to beginners, so here you will learn in simple terms of stocks and bonds, which are the most common securities.</p>
        <p>Stocks and bonds are both types of investments, but they work quite differently.
            Stocks are shares of ownership in a company. When you buy stocks, you become a part-owner of that company. If the company does well, the value of your stocks can go up, and you might receive dividends, which are a share of the company’s profits. However, if the company doesn’t do well, the value of your stocks could go down.
            Bonds, on the other hand, are like loans. When you buy a bond, you’re lending money to the entity that issued the bond, which could be a government, municipality, or corporation. In return, they agree to pay you back the full amount of the loan on a specific date and to pay you interest periodically. Bonds are generally considered less risky than stocks because you expect to get a certain amount of money back unless the issuer defaults.
            In simple terms, buying stocks is like getting a piece of a company, and buying bonds is like lending money with the promise of being paid back with interest.
